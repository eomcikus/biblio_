# KIDLIT
KidLit is a website inspired by GoodReads, but with a focus on children's literature. Its creator, Erin Omcikus, has a love of 'kid lit' and a former educator. KidLit's mission is to remind parents of the importance of read-alouds beyond the early grades, and recommend books that start a conversation and help kids practice empathy. KidLit users can find books, create a listing for a new book, edit and delete their books.
Users can also write reviews for books, as well as read other's reviews, and edit and delete their own reviews.
Friends and likes features will be coming soon!
